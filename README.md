The dataset Manhattan12.csv provides basic information about the house
location, building class, tax class and target to predict the sales price based on the
data provided. It can be modelled in supervised algorithms as the target variable
that needs to be predicted is given in the dataset. The dataset is widespread across
the time and different dates of sale during the years.
